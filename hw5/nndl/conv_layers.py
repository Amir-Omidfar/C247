def conv_forward_naive(x, w, b, conv_param):
  """
  A naive implementation of the forward pass for a convolutional layer.

  The input consists of N data points, each with C channels, height H and width
  W. We convolve each input with F different filters, where each filter spans
  all C channels and has height HH and width HH.

  Input:
  - x: Input data of shape (N, C, H, W)
  - w: Filter weights of shape (F, C, HH, WW)
  - b: Biases, of shape (F,)
  - conv_param: A dictionary with the following keys:
    - 'stride': The number of pixels between adjacent receptive fields in the
      horizontal and vertical directions.
    - 'pad': The number of pixels that will be used to zero-pad the input.

  - out: Output data, of shape (N, F, H', W') where H' and W' are given by
