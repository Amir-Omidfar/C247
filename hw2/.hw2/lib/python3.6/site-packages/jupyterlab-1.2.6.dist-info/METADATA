An extensible environment for interactive and reproducible computing, based on the
Jupyter Notebook and Architecture. [Currently ready for users.](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906)

[JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-generation user interface for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) offering
all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook,
terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and
powerful user interface.
JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook.

JupyterLab can be extended using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages
that use our public APIs. To find JupyterLab extensions, search for the npm keyword [jupyterlab-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:jupyterlab-extension) or the GitHub topic [jupyterlab-extension](https://github.com/topics/jupyterlab-extension). To learn more about extensions, see the [user documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html).

The current JupyterLab releases are suitable for general
usage, and the extension APIs will continue to
evolve for JupyterLab extension developers.

Read the latest version's documentation on [ReadTheDocs](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting started

### Installation

JupyterLab can be installed using `conda` or `pip`. For more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

Project installation instructions from the git sources are available in the [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### conda

If you use `conda`, you can install it with:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

### pip

If you use `pip`, you can install it with:

```shell
pip install jupyterlab
```

If installing using `pip install --user`, you must add the user-level `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in order to launch `jupyter lab`.

#### Installing with Previous Versions of Jupyter Notebook

When using a version of Jupyter Notebook earlier than 5.3, the following command must be run
after installation to enable the JupyterLab server extension:

```bash
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix
```

### Running

Start up JupyterLab using:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

JupyterLab will open automatically in the browser. See the [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html) for additional details.

### Prerequisites and Supported Browsers

Jupyter notebook version 4.3 or later is required. To check the notebook version, run the command:

```bash
jupyter notebook --version
```

The latest versions of the following browsers are currently _known to work_:

- Firefox
- Chrome
- Safari

See our [documentation](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html) for additional details.

## Getting help

We encourage you to ask questions on the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/jupyterlab). A question answered there can become a useful resource for others.

Please use the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues) to provide feedback or submit a bug report. To keep resolved issues self-contained, the [lock bot](https://github.com/apps/lock) will lock closed issues as resolved after a period of inactivity. If related discussion is still needed after an issue is locked, please open a new issue and reference the old issue.

### Weekly Dev Meeting

We have videoconference meetings every week where we discuss what we have been working on and get feedback from one another.

Anyone is welcome to attend, if they would like to discuss a topic or just to listen in.
