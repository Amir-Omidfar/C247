def affine_forward(x, w, b):

  Computes the forward pass for an affine (fully-connected) layer.

  The input x has shape (N, d_1, ..., d_k) and contains a minibatch of N
  examples, where each example x[i] has shape (d_1, ..., d_k). We will
  reshape each input into a vector of dimension D = d_1 * ... * d_k, and
  then transform it to an output vector of dimension M.

  Inputs:
  - x: A numpy array containing input data, of shape (N, d_1, ..., d_k)
